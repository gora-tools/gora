# Gate-defining file (ADR-0016 rule 7). The container images the gates run, pinned by the
# digest of their multi-platform index. Never built: scripts/gate/image.sh prints one by its
# stage name, and the Makefile and CI take it from there. The file exists in this form so
# that Dependabot (docker), which reads every *Dockerfile, proposes their updates.
#
# linux-gate: make verify-linux and docker-platform-check. Its uv is the exact uv of the
#   Dockerfile's uv stage (tests/unit/test_build_pins.py): a uv bump changes both together.
# buildkit:   the builder of the release image, in CI and in the release workflow.
# registry:   the registry CI assembles the image index in, on every pull request.
